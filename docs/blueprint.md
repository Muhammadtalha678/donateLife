# **App Name**: LifeLine Navbar

## Core Features:

- Navigation Menu: Essential navigation links for key site sections (Home, About, Contact).
- Primary Call-to-Action Buttons: Clear and direct buttons for 'Donate Blood' and 'Request Blood'.
- Responsive Layout: The design adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes.
- Hero Section: A prominent hero section at the top of the page, which can serve as an initial brand statement.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep red (#B71C1C), evoking the life-saving aspect of blood donation.
- Background color: Light grey (#F5F5F5), for a clean, non-distracting backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) is chosen as the accent, analogous to red, but with good contrast. The accent adds a touch of calmness and approachability, vital in sensitive contexts.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), providing a clean, modern, and highly readable typeface suitable for all text elements.
- Whitespace: Intentional use of whitespace to ensure clarity, balance, and focus, avoiding clutter.
- Hero Section: Consists of compelling header text that draws the viewer in. Also contains the key calls to action, such as donating blood, requesting blood, and any educational resources available.
- Use minimalist, easily recognizable icons for navigation items. Example: A drop of blood for 'Donate Blood' and an ambulance icon for 'Request Blood'.
